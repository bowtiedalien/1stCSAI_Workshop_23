# Pre-Session Manual for Mobile App Development Session - CSAI Workshop 2023
_Sara:_ I created this manual to help you prepare for the Mobile App development session. You'll find below an index of the contents of this file. You'll need to install Flutter and all its requirements first. Try running the hello world app that comes pre-built with it to make sure your environment is all set. Or otherwise make sure that the output to the command `flutter doctor` does not give you any errors or warnings.

Flutter's documentation is pretty awesome, so hopefully you won't run into any problems following it. There's an extra section that I added for installing Flutter _without Android Studio_, if you're a bit short on disk storage, which is not included in the official documentation so I prepared it myself. If you run into any problems following this section, please do get in touch with me before the session at t-sarahahmed@zewailcity.edu.eg. I'll be happy to help.

## Setting Up Flutter 

- For installing Flutter on any operating system, go to the [official Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install), choose your operating system and follow the instructions.


## Setting Up Flutter on VSCode (without installing Android Studio)

## 1. Install Flutter SDK

- Download the Flutter SDK from the [official Flutter website](https://flutter.dev).
- Extract the downloaded SDK archive to a desired location on your computer.
- Add the Flutter SDK to your system's PATH variable. This allows you to run Flutter commands from anywhere in the terminal/command prompt.
- Verify the installation by opening a new terminal/command prompt window and running the command: `flutter doctor`. It should display a checklist with any missing dependencies or configurations.

## 2. Install Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

- Download and install Visual Studio Code from the [official VSCode website](https://code.visualstudio.com).
- Open VSCode and install the Flutter and Dart extensions. Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X), search for "Flutter" and "Dart", and install the respective extensions provided by the Dart Code team.

## 3. Set up Flutter in VSCode

- Open VSCode and navigate to the settings by going to File > Preferences > Settings or using the shortcut Ctrl+, (comma).
- In the settings, search for "flutter.sdkPath".
- Click on "Edit in settings.json" to modify the user settings.
- Add the following line to the settings.json file, replacing `<flutter-sdk-path>` with the path to your Flutter SDK:
  ```json
  "dart.flutterSdkPath": "<flutter-sdk-path>"
  ```
- Save the file and close the settings.

## 4. Create a new Flutter project

- Open a terminal or command prompt window.
- Navigate to the directory where you want to create your Flutter project.
- Run the following command to create a new Flutter project:
  ```bash
  flutter create my_app
  ```
  (Replace "my_app" with the desired name for your project.)

## 5. Open the Flutter project in VSCode

- Open VSCode.
- Go to File > Open Folder (Ctrl+K Ctrl+O) and select the folder of your Flutter project.
- VSCode will analyze the project and install any missing dependencies automatically.

## 6. Configure and run the Flutter project

- Connect a physical device or set up an emulator for running the Flutter project.
- Open the terminal in VSCode by going to View > Terminal (Ctrl+`).
- Run the following command to check if the Flutter project can be run:
  ```bash
  flutter run
  ```
- VSCode will detect the connected device/emulator and build the project. The app should launch on the device/emulator if everything is set up correctly.

## 7. Enable Developer Options on your Android device

- Go to the "Settings" app on your Android device.
- Scroll down and tap on "About phone" or "About device."
- Look for the "Build number" or "Build version" entry.
- Tap on the "Build number" entry seven times consecutively. You should see a message indicating that Developer Options are enabled.

## 8. Enable USB Debugging on your Android device

- Go back to the main "Settings" screen.
- Scroll down and tap on "Developer options" or "Developer settings."
- Toggle the "Developer options" switch at the top of the screen to enable it.
- Scroll down and locate the "USB debugging" option.
- Enable the "USB debugging" option by toggling the switch next to it.

## 9. Connect your Android device to your computer

- Use a USB cable to connect your Android device to your computer.
- Ensure that your device is unlocked and the screen is active.

## 10. Verify device connection

- Open a terminal or command prompt window on your computer.
- Run the following command to verify that your device is detected by Flutter:
  ```bash
  flutter devices
  ```
- You should see your connected device listed in the output.

## 11. Run the Flutter project on your device

- In VSCode, make sure you have your Flutter project open.
- Open the terminal in VSCode by going to View > Terminal (Ctrl+`).
- Run the following command to build and run your Flutter project on your connected device:
  ```bash
  flutter run
  ```
- Flutter will build the project and install it on your device.
- If prompted, grant any necessary permissions on your device to run the app.

## 12. Test and debug your Flutter app

- Once the app is installed on your device, you can interact with it as you would with any other app.
- If you encounter any issues or want to debug your app, you can use the debugging tools provided by VSCode and Flutter. Set breakpoints, inspect variables, and use the debugging features to analyze and fix any problems.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up Flutter, run it on VSCode, and utilize USB debugging on your mobile devices. Enjoy developing and testing your Flutter applications using this setup!

## Setting Up your Phone for USB Debugging
To be able to run apps on your Android phone, you'll need to set up USB debugging, which basically means giving permission to your laptop to build and install apps on your phone through a USB cable. The following instructions would only work for an Android phone. 

**To set up USB debugging on your Android phone, you'll need to enable Developer Options and then enable USB debugging within those options. Here's a step-by-step guide:**

1. **Enable Developer Options:**
   - Go to the "Settings" app on your Android phone.
   - Scroll down and look for "About phone" or "About device" (the exact name may vary depending on your device).

   - Tap on "About phone" and locate the "Build number" or "Build version" entry.

   - Tap on the "Build number" entry multiple times (typically seven times) until you see a message indicating that you are now a developer.

2. **Enable USB Debugging:**
   - Go back to the main settings menu.
   - You should now see a new option called "Developer Options" or "Developer settings" listed. Tap on it.

   - Look for the "USB debugging" option and toggle it on.

   - You may see a warning message explaining the risks of enabling USB debugging. Read it carefully, and if you agree, select "OK" or "Allow" to proceed.

3. **Connect your Phone to your Computer:**
   - Use a USB cable to connect your Android phone to your computer.
   - If prompted on your phone, choose the "File Transfer" or "Transfer files" option.
   - On your computer, make sure you have the appropriate USB drivers installed for your Android phone. Most devices will automatically install the necessary drivers, but if not, you can download them from your phone manufacturer's website.

4. **Verify USB Debugging:**
   - Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the location where you extracted the platform tools.
   - Type the command `adb devices` or `flutter devices` and press Enter.
   - If everything is set up correctly, you should see your device listed as a connected device with a device ID.

That's it! USB debugging is now enabled on your Android phone, and you can use it for various development tasks, such as deploying and debugging apps from your computer.
